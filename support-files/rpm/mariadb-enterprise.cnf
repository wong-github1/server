# This file provides a set of sensible default settings. If you need
# to override these, you should add a new .cnf file in the appropriate
# directory for your system. Make sure the name of your file starts
# with a filename that sorts "later" than the name of this file. For
# example, if you want to override the settings in
# mariadb-enterprise.cnf, put your own options in a file that starts
# with a name like "zebra" rather than a name like "apple".
# If you have questions about the contents of this file, how to tune
